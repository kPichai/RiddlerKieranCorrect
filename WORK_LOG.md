| Aug 23 | 11:40am - 12:10pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  During class time I initially started figuring out each cipher. I have confident conceptual solutions for #1, #2, and #3. By the end of this working block I was still thinking about and working on #4. By this point in time I had not yet coded anything. |
| Aug 24 |  3:45pm - 4:15pm  |                                                                                                                                                           During this working session I began by coding decoder #1. This step involved learning how to manipulate ASCII values and shift them which is something I haven't done in a while. Although this problem was mathematically or conceptually difficult I struggled to correctly make #1 work. During my troubleshooting process I realized I was incorrectly shifting the wrap-around values for capital and lowercase numbers. I then fixed this towards the end of the session and ran the test, #1 now works well. |
| Aug 24 |  4:15pm - 4:45pm  | During this session I switched to working on code #2. This one required more thinking as too how to code the solution and the path the computer would take to generate an answer. I opted to have the computer generate the ASCII values given from the string then each time it came up with a completed ASCII value it would convert it to a char then append it to the decrypted string. I believe the answer is correct and the check works (as the text matches the Walrus and the Carpenter poem) however, the syntax / punctuation does seem to be a bit different so I'm wondering if thats my fault coding wise or whether the poem is actually formatted like that. |

During class I had realized that this code is ASCII values disguised by binary bytes. I split the string into groups of 8 digits then used parseInt with a radix (base) of 2 (binary) to convert each byte to ASCII values. I finally converted these ASCII values to chars and appended each new char to the decrypted string. Logic wise, this one was by far the easiest to complete. |

I abstracted problem 1 by adding a helpler function. I also then worked on boosting the style of my code for problems 1-3, adding comments, and making sure spacin and syntax were consistent. I thought about problem 4 on paper some more and came up with the idea that it might have something to do with unicode but I haven't fully figured it out yet and thus have no code for it. |
